### About the Kaggle Competition
This project is part of a Kaggle competition presented by Break Through Tech AI in collaboration with the [Algorithmic Justice League (AJL)](https://www.ajl.org/about). Participants include AI Fellows from the Virtual, Boston (MIT), and Los Angeles (UCLA) programs.

### Objective of the Challenge
The goal of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies skin conditions across diverse skin tones. This is a critical issue in dermatology, where existing models often fail to diagnose conditions accurately in patients with darker skin tones due to biased and unrepresentative training data.

### Real-World Significance
AI has rapidly changed industries, including healthcare, by automating complex tasks like diagnosing medical conditions. However, many AI models are built using biased and unbalanced datasets, making them less effective for diverse populations.

In dermatology, AI models often struggle to identify skin conditions on a wide range of skin tones. This leads to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment, especially for low-income communities of color. These biases reinforce existing healthcare disparities and put vulnerable groups at greater risk.

As data and machine learning engineers, we have a responsibility to challenge these biases and develop fair, inclusive AI models. Through this project, we aim to reduce bias in dermatology AI models by training on more diverse and representative data. Our goal is to build a highly accurate model that improves healthcare for vulnerable communities, so that all patients receive accurate and reliable diagnoses, regardless of their skin tone.

## **üìä Data Exploration**

**Describe:**

* The dataset(s) used (i.e., the data provided in Kaggle \+ any additional sources)
* Data exploration and preprocessing approaches
* Challenges and assumptions when working with the dataset(s)

**Potential visualizations to include:**

* Plots, charts, heatmaps, feature visualizations, sample dataset images

## **üß† Model Development**

**Describe (as applicable):**

* Model(s) used (e.g., CNN with transfer learning, regression models)
* Feature selection and Hyperparameter tuning strategies
* Training setup (e.g., % of data for training/validation, evaluation metric, baseline performance)


**Methodology**: To meet our goals and objectives, we will be using a sequential Convolution Neural Network (CNN) since we will need our model to learn from the images in our data. To do this, we will be using tensorflow keras for importing and building our neural network. This is our optimal choice of modeling because of the many layers we can build on, allowing each layer to learn to detect the different features within an image which will be very useful in classifying skin conditions across the different features (i.e. skin color) of patients.
