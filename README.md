## Project overview and Objectives

Kaggle competition presented by Break Through Tech and the [Algorithmic Justice League (AJL)](https://www.ajl.org/about). Break Through Tech AI Fellows from the Virtual, Boston (MIT), and Los Angeles (UCLA) programs participated in this Kaggle competition.


With the rise of AI over the past few years, tasks within diverse fields, like in healthcare, that once required extensive human labor have now been simplified with models that can easily and quickly classify large amounts of data. However, the data that has been used for these models thus far have been filled with problematic patterns of bias, unrepresentative of a wide range of individuals, racist, and overall lacking the inclusivity of different identities. As a result, we see models that succeed for certain groups more than others and at the same time continue discriminating against marginalized and vulnerable groups-- these groups usually being low-income communities of color. 

The Algorithmic Justic League (AJL) is an organization that works to combat the social implications and harms around AI as the one described earlier. In this project, we will work to build a model that classifies skin conditions across diverse skin tones, as this is currently a challenge being seen within dermatology and the models being used for diagnoses. It is imperative that our project challenges the current models being used because of the potential misdiagnosing and harm being done to vulnerable communities. Therefore, it is our role and responsibility as data and machine learning engineers to ethically combat the current models being used in dermatology by training a model that learns from a diverse and inclusive set of data. In doing so, we aim to limit any biases and poor models that are currently misdiagnosing marginalized patients with skin conditions.
